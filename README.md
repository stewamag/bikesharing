# Bike Sharing

Using Tableau to analyze CitiBike data from August 2019 in New York City.

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this project was to analyze CitiBike data to determine the profitability of creating a similar business in Des Moines.

## Results: 

Over the course of August 2019, there were 2.3 million CitiBike rides in New York City. 

### Checkout Times for Users:

Based off the visualization below, most bike rides lasted 30 minutes or less. The ride duration peaked at 6 minutes.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour:

The CitiBikes were used most frequently during rush-hours (from 7-9 am and 4-7 pm). The most common time and day for bike rides was Thursdays between 5-6 pm.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour):

Most rides were completed by male identifying individuals. Other than the total number of rides, there was not a difference between the genders as per time and day. It was very similar.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday:

Most user trips were completed by male identifying individuals who subscribed to the service. They were less likely to bike on weekends and most likely to bike on Thursdays.

### Peak August Hours:

Most rides occured during morning and evening rush hour. If maintenance we to need to be performed, the best time to do so would be between 1 am and 5 am. The fewest rides occured during that time, so it would be the most convenient time to remove bikes from rotation.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

Based off of this data, it is possible that a similar business would do well in Des Moines, but it would also require further investigation. Since subscribers and male identifying individuals are the most common users, it would be important to make sure that there is a large enough section of the workforce in Des Moines that would fit this criteria. A dataset showing how many male identifying individuals live and work in metropolitan Des Moines would be important to get ahold of. If there are not enough of them, the business will likely not do as well as hoped.

It would also be a good idea to look at the datasets from other months in NYC to see if the same patterns emerge. When it is colder out, is this still a profitable business?

Another thing to consider is the difference in the two cities being compared. The demographic and lifestyle of New York City differs greatly from that of Des Moines. Are people likely to even bike in Des Moines? Are cars more heavily relied upon? Would it be easy to access all parts of the city by bike? A geographical analysis of Des Moines might also be beneficial.

Further investigation is required.
